# Example pfailover configuration
#
# pfailover operates by running "Monitors" that continually ping a host to test for connectivity.  
# When a threshold is passed of being unable to ping a host, pfailover will execute scripts
# which (normally) change the routing table, send an email notification, update log files, etc.

# Each monitor definition starts with the name of the monitor in brackets
;[example] 

# dst defines what IP to ping.  This is also sent as the first argument to the scripts when run.
;  dst = 1.2.3.4

# count defines how many pings we perform in each group.
# If unspecified, defaults to 5.
;  count = 5

# interval defines how many seconds we wait between groups of pings.
# If unspecified, defaults to 20.
;  interval = 20

# fail defines how many pings must be dropped in each group of pings to count as a group failure
# If unspecified, defaults to 3
;  fail = 3

# alert defines how many gorup failures must occur before the change scripts are executed
# If unspecified, defaults to 2
;  alert = 2


# In the folowing example, we monitor for connectivity by pinging 10.200.50.50.
# Every 30 seconds, pfailover will send 10 pings.  If 7 or more of those pings fail,
# the group fails.  Upon pfailover registering 3 failed groups, the state will change
# and the mon1.secondary script will be executed.  While in the failed state, if the network 
# interface registers 3 successful ping groups to 10.200.50.50, the state will
# change and the mon1.primary script will be executed.
#
# script files must be stored in the same directory as pfailover.conf
#
